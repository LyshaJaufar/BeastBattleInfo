            4 years later, in 2022, founder Lysha has kicked off the production of a digital adaptation of the exisiting Beast Battle game. Presently, only a much simpler rendition of the game has been made. There are plans for the production of an official game that perfectly replicates and is an improved version of the original game in the near future. Today, the much simpler model features only 18 cards.
